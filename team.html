        <p>
          Fearless into Tech is a non-profit initiative from women for women.
        </p>
        <p>
          What brings us together is our strong will to hack into the digital
          sector, regardless of lacking a technical career background or
          related education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our community offers women a safe space to acquire new digital
          skills at their own pace, while at the same time building own
          networks, supporting each other and keeping track of individual and
          common goals.

        <h2>Our mission:</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to make the Tech Sector more accessible for women and
          minorities from outside the sector, seeking for a career change from
          non-tech to tech.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Due to the latent gender gap in the sector, we mainly focus on
          offering women a safe and solidarious space to acquire new digital
          skills at their own pace, while having access to free learning
          resources, peer-support and guidance by professional mentors.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          While we believe in skill transferability and human potential, we
          also believe that closing the gender gap in the Tech Sector requires
          a common effort. Acknowledging our stereotypes and biases towards
          the sector can help shifting our perception of tech related
          professions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          At Fearless into Tech we want to inspire our community members by
          showcasing stories of diverse role models and their very diverse
          career paths into Tech, and tech companies by showcasing that talent
          and skill development is neither static nor dependent on
          certificates / titles, but rather driven by the unlimited human
          drive to learn, explore and create.

          She founded FIT to motivate people who - like herself -have hardly
          had previous exposure or access to tech, but are open and willing to
          fearlessly dive into it, and explore how far they can get with the
          support of a community. Since moving to Denmark in 2017, Eli has
          transitioned from a career in International Development Cooperation
          to a position as a Technical Pre-Sales Engineer in an upcoming
          Danish Startup.

        <p>
          Gender diversity and women’s empowerment have always been issues she
          has been passionate about. While doing her masters, coding and data
          analytics piqued her curiosity but she was always too scared to try
          it out. When Eli came up with the idea behind the Fearless into Tech
          community, it was a perfect fit.

          Fearless into Tech seminar in autumn 2019, she got interested in
          this initiative, so she joined F.I.T. first as a member of a Python
          learning circle and later as a Board member and one of the
          moderators.
