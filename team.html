          Fearless into Tech is a non-profit initiative from women for women.
        </p>
        <p>
          What brings us together is our strong will to hack into the digital
          sector, regardless of lacking a technical career background or related
          education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our community offers women a safe space to acquire new digital skills
          at their own pace, while at the same time building own networks,
          supporting each other and keeping track of individual and common
          goals.

        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to make the Tech Sector more accessible for women and
          minorities from outside the sector, seeking for a career change from
          non-tech to tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the latent gender gap in the sector, we mainly focus on
          offering women a safe and solidarious space to acquire new digital
          skills at their own pace, while having access to free learning
          resources, peer-support and guidance by professional mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we believe in skill transferability and human potential, we also
          believe that closing the gender gap in the Tech Sector requires a
          common effort. Acknowledging our stereotypes and biases towards the
          sector can help shifting our perception of tech related professions.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Fearless into Tech we want to inspire our community members by
          showcasing stories of diverse role models and their very diverse
          career paths into Tech, and tech companies by showcasing that talent
          and skill development is neither static nor dependent on certificates
          / titles, but rather driven by the unlimited human drive to learn,
          explore and create.

            She founded FIT to motivate people who - like herself -have hardly
            had previous exposure or access to tech, but are open and willing to
            fearlessly dive into it, and explore how far they can get with the
            support of a community. Since moving to Denmark in 2017, Eli has
            transitioned from a career in International Development Cooperation
            to a position as a Technical Pre-Sales Engineer in an upcoming
            Danish Startup.

            A Political Scientist, Claudia has previously worked within
            research. After relocating to Copenhagen, she made a career change
            into the private sector and she currently works full time as an IP

            Gender diversity and women’s empowerment have always been issues she
            has been passionate about. While doing her masters, coding and data
            analytics piqued her curiosity but she was always too scared to try
            it out. When Eli came up with the idea behind the Fearless into Tech
            community, it was a perfect fit.

            For the last 15 years Oxana has been working in the UN system, and
            such topics as diversity,gender equality and capacity building of
            women were a big part of her professional life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2015 Oxana moved from Moscow to Copenhagen as a Master student in
            CBS, studying Supply Chain Management. After visiting the very first
            Fearless into Tech seminar in autumn 2019, she got interested in
            this initiative, so she joined F.I.T. first as a member of a Python
            learning circle and later as a Board member and one of the
            moderators.
