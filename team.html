                <p>Fearless into Tech is a non-profit initiative from women for women.</p>
                <p>What brings us together is our strong will to hack into the digital sector, regardless of lacking a
                    technical career background or related education.</p>
                <p>Our community offers women a safe space to acquire new digital skills at their own pace, while at the
                    same time building own networks, supporting each other and keeping track of individual and common
                    goals.</p>

                <h2 class="subtitle">Our mission:</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to make the Tech Sector more accessible for women and minorities from outside the
                    sector, seeking for a career change from non-tech to tech.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Due to the latent gender gap in the sector, we mainly focus on offering women a safe and solidarious
                    space to acquire new digital skills at their own pace, while having access to free learning
                    resources, peer-support and guidance by professional mentors. </p>
                <br>
                <p>While we believe in skill transferability and human potential, we also believe that closing the
                    gender gap in the Tech Sector requires a common effort. Acknowledging our stereotypes and biases
                    towards the sector can help shifting our perception of tech related professions. </p>
                <br>
                <p>At Fearless into Tech we want to inspire our community members by showcasing stories of diverse role
                    models and their very diverse career paths into Tech, and tech companies by showcasing that talent
                    and skill development is neither static nor dependent on certificates / titles, but rather driven by
                    the unlimited human drive to learn, explore and create.</p>

                    unleash their full potential, when given equal opportunities.</p>
                <p>She founded FIT to motivate people who - like herself -  have hardly had previous exposure or access
                    to tech, but are open and willing to fearlessly dive into it, and explore how far they can get with
                    the support of a community. Since moving to Denmark in 2017, Eli has transitioned from a career in
                    International Development Cooperation to a position as a Technical Pre-Sales Engineer in an upcoming
                    Danish Startup.</p>

                    she made a career change into the private sector and she currently works full time as an IP

                <p>
                <p>Gender diversity and women’s empowerment have always been issues she has been passionate about. While
                    doing her masters, coding and data analytics piqued her curiosity but she was always too scared to
                    try it out. When Eli came up with the idea behind the Fearless into Tech community, it was a perfect
                    fit.</p>

                    equality and capacity building of women were a big part of her professional life. </p>
                <p>In 2015 Oxana moved from Moscow to Copenhagen as a Master student in CBS, studying Supply Chain
                    Management. After visiting the very first Fearless into Tech seminar in autumn 2019, she got
                    interested in this initiative, so she joined F.I.T. first as a member of a Python learning circle
                    and later as a Board member and one of the moderators.</p>
